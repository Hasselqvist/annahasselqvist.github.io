### Gender Differences and Sibling Spillovers in Migrant Families
The school performance of children from migrant families are on average lower than that of their classmates. The skills that the child forms at home before school start is likely to differ between families where the parents have grown up in the country and have first-hand experience of the school system, or if the parents have migrated. Older siblings are potentially important role models when the parent’s knowledge and resources are limited. Recent discussions in the Swedish policy debate about how to improve the school results of children from migrant families have centered around interventions early in life. In 2018 the pre-school class was made mandatory for all six-year-olds. In 2019 the Swedish government issued a commission of inquiry into whether a mandatory language preschool should be instated for children of newly arrived migrants . Despite these efforts, there are few research studies that have examined whether formal education at a younger age promotes learning among children with migrant backgrounds.   

This project looks at how the school performance of children from migrant families are impacted by starting school at a relatively older age, and if the oldest child’s school-starting age affects the performance of younger siblings. The home and early language environment likely differs between children in migrant and native families. It is possible that earlier school start, which implies an earlier exposure to Swedish education, is relatively more beneficial for children from migrant families. Since Linguistics research has shown that early-life proficiency in both first and second languages are slower for boys than for girls, early school start may be especially helpful for boys. Furthermore, if the oldest sibling is benefiting from older school start, chances are higher that he or she is a positive role model for a younger sibling’s learning. But if an oldest sibling is not benefiting from older school start, younger siblings may be disadvantaged if parents with limited resources compensating for this fact spends more time helping the older sibling with schoolwork.
