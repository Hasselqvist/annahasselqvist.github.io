**In the Shadow of Brothers: Educational Achievements of Migrant Girls**

Gender-bias in parental investments can have subtle implications for how education policies impact migrant girls. For them, remaining at home with a brother could reduce the parental investments if parents value sons' education over daughters'. Using exogenous variation created by a Swedish school-entry policy, I analyze how prolonged time at home with siblings before entering public education impacts migrant girls' human capital formation. This is done in two ways. I first examine the direct effect of entering school late on migrant girls' school performance and how it varies by the gender of the younger sibling. I then examine the sibling spillovers on migrant girls when an older sister or brother enters school late. The results provide two important implications. First, late school entry only benefits migrant girls with younger sisters but not those with younger brothers. Second, prolonged time at home with an oldest brother has lasting negative spillover effects on younger sisters' school outcomes. These negative impacts are unique to migrant girls and likely stem from parents' gender bias, as boys and native children do not experience similar effects. The effects are more pronounced in families from more traditional backgrounds, and can partly account for differences in mothers' labor decisions when sons and daughters enter school late.
