**In the Shadow of Brothers: Unintended Impacts of a School Entry Policy on Migrant Girls**

If parents favor sons over daughters in their investments, this gender bias could impact girls' success in the education system. This study investigates how family structure shapes the effects of Sweden's school entry policy on girls in migrant families, where cultural norms may lead parents to exhibit gender bias. Using a regression discontinuity design on high-quality administrative data, I first assess the direct effects of late school entry, showing that it benefits migrant girls with younger sisters but not those with younger brothers. Furthermore, by investigating sibling spillover effects from an older sibling's late school entry, I demonstrate that spending more time at home with an older brother who enters school late has a strong negative effect on the educational outcomes of younger sisters. I propose a simple theory to explain these results, highlighting gender bias in parental preferences as a key factor. Supporting this interpretation, I present evidence showing that these negative impacts are specific to migrant girls, with neither migrant boys nor native children experiencing similar effects. Moreover, the effects are more pronounced in migrant families with traditional backgrounds and are also reflected in mothers' labor supply decisions when sons, rather than daughters, enter school late.
