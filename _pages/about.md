I am a phd candidate at the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en) and the [University of Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University.

My research interests include topics in family economics, economics of education, and economics of migration and integration.

 I received my master's and bachelor's degrees from [Uppsala University](https://www.nek.uu.se/?languageId=1).

## Work in progress

* Joint versus Sole Custody after Divorce: Causal Effects on Child Outcomes and Family Environment
