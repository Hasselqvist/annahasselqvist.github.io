I am a fourth year phd candidate at the ifo center for labor and demographic economics at the University of Munich. I received both my master and bachelor degree from Uppsala University.

My research interests are family economics, economics of education, and economics of migration and integration.

## Work in progress

* Joint versus Sole Custody after Divorce: Causal Effects on Child Outcomes and Family Environment. 

* Do immigrant children benefit from early school start?
