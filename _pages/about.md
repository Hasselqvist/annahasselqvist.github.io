I am a phd candidate at the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en) and the [University of Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University.

My areas of interest are Family and Education Economics, with a special focus on interventions aimed at improving equal opportunities for children from diverse backgrounds. I am particularly interested in topics related to the integration of migrant families.


 I received my master's and bachelor's degrees from [Uppsala University](https://www.nek.uu.se/?languageId=1).

## Work in progress

* In the Shadow of Brothers: Educational Achievements of Migrant Girls

* Joint versus Sole Custody after Divorce: Causal Effects on Child Outcomes and Family Environment
