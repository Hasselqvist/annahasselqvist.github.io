I am a fourth year phd candidate at the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en) and the [University of Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University. I received my masters and bachelors degrees from Uppsala University.

My research interests are family economics, economics of education, and economics of migration and integration.

## Work in progress

* Joint versus Sole Custody after Divorce: Causal Effects on Child Outcomes and Family Environment. 

* School starting age, sibling spillovers, and the academic performance of second-generation migrants
