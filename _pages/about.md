I am a phd candidate at the [ifo Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en) and the [University of Munich](https://www.en.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and affiliated with [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University.

In the spring of 2024 I am visiting the [Economics Department](https://economics.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

My research interests lie at the intersection of family economics and the economics of education, with a special focus on interventions that can improve the equality of opportunity for children from different backgrounds. I have a keen interest in topics related to the integration of migrant families.


 I received my master's and bachelor's degrees from [Uppsala University](https://www.nek.uu.se/?languageId=1).

## Work in progress

* Joint versus Sole Custody after Divorce: Causal Effects on Child Outcomes and Family Environment

* Gender Differences and Sibling Spillovers in Migrant Families
